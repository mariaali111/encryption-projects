# Encyption Projects

This repository contains C programs for classic encryption techniques:

## Programs
1. **Caesar Cipher**
   - Shift-based encryption
   - Supports encryption and decryption
2. **Substitution Cipher**
   - User-defined key for substitution
   - Handles uppercase and lowercase letters

## Usage
Compile and run the programs using GCC:

```bash
gcc caesar/caesar.c -o caesar
./caesar
```

```bash
gcc substitution/substitution.c -o substitution
./substitution
```
